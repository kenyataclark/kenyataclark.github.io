<h1>Resume</h1>

<p>I do not have a lot of work experience, having only worked two jobs while attending school. These jobs are not aligned with the proposal/technical writer career that I want to pursue. However, they did provide me with valuable skills that will help me in the future.</p>

<p>My resume consists of 4 sections:
	<ul>
	<li>Professional Overview</li>
	<li>Professional Skills</li>
	<li>Work Experience</li>
	<li>Education </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The Professional Overview section is the basic summary of my skills and experience for companies initial read. Since I am applying to multiple writing jobs, I left it very generic.</p>

<p>My Professional Skills section is a compilation of all of the skills that I have gained over my years of working, combined with my skills learned from my education.

<p>The Work Experience and Education sections are self explanatory.</p>

<p>Here is my current, updated resume</p>
