<h1>Career Aspirations</h1>

<p>I aspire to become a proposal writer after graduating. I am actively pursuing a certificate in proposal writing, which I expect to complete by the end of the month. My goal is to become a professional proposal writer, using my skills gained through my college experience to craft compelling proposals that drive real-world impact and support organizations in achieving their missions. I even joined a local proposal writer organization to help drive my professional development and build my network.</p>

<p>A huge part of my professional development as an aspiring proposal writer is my network and social media presence on LinkedIn. In my Engh 488 class last semester, we were tasked to develop our LinkedIn page and start netwroking with other professionals who were in alignment with out career aspirations. I completed this assignment and have since continued to make connections with working proposal writers, managers, and analysts. </p>
