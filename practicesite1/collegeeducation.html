<h1>College Education</h1>

<p>My college experience has been a journey of growth and discovery. I began at Northern Virginia Community College, where I pursued Architecture. I took a majority of my prerequisites there, along with some art classes. After completing two years there, I transferred to George Mason University. When I first transferred, I was still pursuing Architecture, but I soon felt pulled in a different direction. I decided to change my major to English.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed reading and writing, plus I was a natural in all of my prerequisite English classes. It felt right! Changing my major was easy, but declaring a concentration was not. Even though I hadn’t yet declared a concentration, I knew I wanted something rooted in writing. After taking a few Writing and Rhetoric courses, I found my passion and knew this was the path I wanted to follow.</p> 

<p>My academic performance wasn’t always perfect. My GPA initially reflected the uncertainty I felt early on. It was becoming a mother that shifted everything for me. Since then, I’ve earned straight A’s and consistently made the Dean’s List, a reflection of both my dedication and personal growth.</p>

<p>Alongside my early confusion about choosing a major, I also struggled with figuring out what I wanted to do after college. It wasn’t until I took four key classes that things began to fall into place. These courses not only sparked my interest but also helped me recognize the kind of work I enjoy and excel at. They gave me practical skills, built my confidence as a writer, and ultimately solidified my career aspirations in writing-focused fields like communications, proposal writitng, and technical writing. The 4 classes include:
<ol>
  <li>Engh 380: Intro to Writing and Rhetoric</li>
  <li>Engh 388: Professional and Technical Writing</li>
  <li>Engh 488: Advanced Proposal Writing</li>
  <li>Engh 485: Document Design</li>
</ol>
