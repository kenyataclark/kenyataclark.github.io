<h1>College Education</h1>

<p>My college experience has been a journey of growth and discovery. I began at Northern Virginia Community College, where I pursued Architecture, but after transferring to George Mason University, I felt pulled in a different direction and decided to major in English. Although I hadn’t yet declared a concentration, I knew I wanted something rooted in writing. After taking a few Writing and Rhetoric courses, I found my passion and knew this was the path I wanted to follow. My academic performance wasn’t always perfect. My GPA initially reflected the uncertainty I felt early on. It was becoming a mother that shifted everything for me. Since then, I’ve earned straight A’s and consistently made the Dean’s List, a reflection of both my dedication and personal growth. </p>

<p>Alongside my early confusion about choosing a major, I also struggled with figuring out what I wanted to do after college. It wasn’t until I took four key classes that things began to fall into place. These courses not only sparked my interest but also helped me recognize the kind of work I enjoy and excel at. They gave me practical skills, built my confidence as a writer, and ultimately solidified my career aspirations in writing-focused fields like communications, content strategy, and technical writing. The 4 classes include: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Engh 380: Intro to Writing and Rhetoric</li>
  <li>Engh 388: Professional and Technical Writing</li>
  <li>Engh 488: Advanced Proposal Writing</li>
  <li>Engh 485: Document Design</li>
</ol>
