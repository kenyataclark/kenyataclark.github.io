	<h2>Resume</h2>
	<article>
	<section>
		<p>I do not have a lot of work experience, having only worked two jobs while attending school. These jobs are not aligned with the proposal/technical writer career that I want to pursue. However, they did provide me with valuable skills that will help me in the future.</p>

		<h3>Resume Sections</h3>
		<p>My resume consists of 4 sections:
			<ul>
			<li>Professional Overview</li>
			<li>Professional Skills</li>
			<li>Work Experience</li>
			<li>Education </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The Professional Overview section is the basic summary of my skills and experience for companies initial read. Since I am applying to multiple writing jobs, I left it very generic.</p>

		<p>My Professional Skills section is a compilation of all of the skills that I have gained over my years of working, combined with my skills learned from my education.

		<p>The Work Experience and Education sections are self explanatory.</p>
