	<p>Hello! My name is Kenyata Clark and I am a senior taking the ENGH 375 Summer Class Web Authoring and Design. I am looking forward to graduating this Fall 2025 semester. I have been between two schools throughout my college journey: Northern Virginia Community College and George Mason. During that time, I worked as a Veteran Services Admin with the State and a Fairfax County Public School Substitue. Since being in school, I have been involved with an on campus club called Intervarsity and I also became a mom.</p>
	
	<p>This website contains a portfolio of my College Education, my Resume, and my Career Aspirations.</p>
